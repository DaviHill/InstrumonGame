## Compiling:
We probably won't have to compile anything until the very end because Unity allows for previewing in the editor,
but here are the steps to compile the final product in Unity.
* Click File > Build Settings
* Select every scene used in the final game
* Pick which platform the game is being exported for (Probably Windows or Mac)
* All settings can be left at their default unless you want otherwise
* Click Build
* Select a local save location
* Navigate to where it is saved and test the build
